How do we modify Big Mountain resortâ€™s pricing strategy in order to make up for the increase in operating costs so that the resort can potentially make a net profit this year?

### CONTEXT
Big Mountain Resort has over 350000 visitors every year, ranging from novices to professionals. The newly installed chair lift, though expensive, will help distribute visitors across the resort, and this might increase the number of visitors in the upcoming year. In order to recoup the costs, we can examine the current ticket prices in resorts across the United States, and decide on a pricing model that will allow us to capitalize on our existing features. We can examine the ticket prices in our CSV file, organized by state, and determine if we should increase the weekday price, the weekend price, or potentially both.

### CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS
This pricing model will be tested in 2019, and it will be considered a success if we are able to increase our revenue by $1540000 at least.

### SCOPE OF SOLUTION SPACE
We are only working with the ticket prices for Big Mountain Resort and examining how to optimize it.

### CONSTRAINTS
Attempting to raise ticket prices can temporarily reduce the number of visitors to the resort, which can cause some backlash.
